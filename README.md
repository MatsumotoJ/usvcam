# USVCAM: acoustic camera system for ultrasonic vocalizations

<img src="./docs/imgs/demo_loc_color.gif" width="300"> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./docs/imgs/demo_assign_icr.gif" width="300"> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./docs/imgs/pic_sensor.jpg" width="150"> 

**USVCAM** is an acoustic camera system for localization and assignment of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) for interacting laboratory rodents. Thanks to its design utilizing a small phased microphone array combined with a camera, USVCAM has many advantages over the previous systems using a distributed microphone array.

## Features
+ Single and compact sensor assembly.
+ Applicable to various experimental apparatuses, e.g., recording in home cages. 
+ Speedy processing (near real-time speed with a single inexpensive PC).
+ Precision comparable to or better than the previous systems.
+ Syllable extraction for each of the simultaneously vocalizing animals.
+ User friendly interfaces and functions.
